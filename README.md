# 🕵️‍♂️ Fraud Detection with Explainable AI (Logistic Regression + SHAP)

## 📌 Project Description  
Fraud detection models are often treated as **black boxes** — they make decisions, but we don’t always know *why*.  
In this project, I built a **fraud detection system** using a **Machine Learning pipeline with Logistic Regression**, and then used **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to bring transparency to the predictions.  

The goal was simple:  
✅ Detect potential fraudulent transactions  
✅ Explain *why* the model flagged them  
✅ Build trust by making the model interpretable  

This way, instead of just saying *“This looks like fraud”*, the model actually shows **which features contributed most** to that decision.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (ML pipeline, Logistic Regression)
- **SHAP** (model explainability)
- **Streamlit** (interactive web app)
- **Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib** (data wrangling + visualization)

---

## 🚀 Features
- End-to-end **ML pipeline** for fraud detection  
- **Logistic Regression model** trained on transaction data  
- **SHAP explainability** plots for both global & local explanations  
- **Streamlit dashboard** to interactively explore predictions  
- Clean & reproducible workflow

## 📊 Example Insights
- **Global explanations**: Which features generally matter the most in fraud detection  
- **Local explanations**: Why a *specific transaction* was flagged as fraud (or not)  
- Intuitive **visualizations** powered by SHAP
